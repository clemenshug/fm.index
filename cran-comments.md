## Resubmission

In this resubmission I have

* Clarified that the package uses the SDSL C++ library for its function,
  not a web service, and added a link to their Github repository
* Added documentation for return values of fm_index_save() and fm_index_load()
* Verified that spelling is correct

## R CMD check results

One note on MacOS 11.6 with R 4.1.3

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  SDSL (10:67)
  corpora (13:49)
